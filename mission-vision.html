            <h2>PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>
                Part of my life revolves on photography, which therefore has a big impact on my creative work.
                It hones my sense of colour, composition, and detail, which enables me to draw inspiration from everyday situations.
                I get creative inspiration from the textures, patterns, and light I observe through the lens.
                My ability to produce visually appealing designs is driven by photography, which improves my capacity to convey ideas.
                It's more than simply a hobby; it's an effective instrument that improves my visual vision and narrative skills as a designer.            </p>

            <h2>DESIGN</h2>
            <p>
                Design is how I create value; it's not just what I do.
                I solve issues, improve user experiences, and realise concepts through careful design.
                Every project offers the chance to combine creativity and utility to produce solutions that are both visually appealing and functional.
                Innovation is driven by design, and its impact goes far beyond aesthetics.
                It creates meaningful experiences and brings value to enterprises, products, and everyday life by influencing how we engage with the outside world.            </p>
