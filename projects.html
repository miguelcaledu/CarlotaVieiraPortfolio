                <p>Flor de Alecrim is a brand identity project created to revitalize and enhance the image of a small, local health food business. 
                    The goal is to help the brand stand out in a competitive market by modernizing its visual identity and improving its overall visibility.

                    By aligning the brand with its core values, the new identity is designed to attract a broader customer base and strengthen local market presence.</p>
